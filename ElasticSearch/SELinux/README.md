# Elasticsearch SElinux policy
This SElinux policy is built by hand for ElasticSearch. In this document I try to track the things I still need to/can do.
You can use the information in the shell script to build and deploy the policy properly. It is not yet intended to run as a script.

TO DO:
- Add proper interfaces
- Try to replace rules by available interfaces
